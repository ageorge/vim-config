vim-config
==========

This is my vim configuration, forked from `fisadev/fisa-vim-config <https://github.com/fisadev/fisa-vim-config>`_ with some drupal specific additions.

* all the vim magic comes from `fisadev/fisa-vim-config <https://github.com/fisadev/fisa-vim-config>`_

* all the vim + drupal magic comes from `vim plugin for drupal <http://drupal.org/project/vimrc>`_ (read `their documentation <http://drupal.org/project/vimrc>`_ for details)

The original .vimrc is mainly oriented to python software development, but many of its features are useful for other languages and editing tasks, and I've added some drupal specific features.

Feel free to distribute it (it's GPL licensed), and I'm not responsible for any good or bad consecuences of using it.

See the `original documentation <https://fisadev.github.io/fisa-vim-config/>`_ for features, installation and usage.
